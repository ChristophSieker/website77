Explored covid-19 death data clearly underlines the importance of social distancing measures in order to protect older and ill society members.

```{r, cache=TRUE}

# URL link to CDC to download data

covid_data <- vroom::vroom(url)%>% 
  clean_names()
```


# Covid death % by age group, sex and presence of co-morbidities

```{r, cache=TRUE}

#glimpse(covid_data)

#Data cleaning

  filter(medcond_yn != "Unknown") %>% 
  filter(death_yn != "Unknown") %>% 
  filter(death_yn != "Missing") %>%
  filter(age_group != "Unknown") %>% 
  filter(sex != "Missing") %>% 
  filter(sex != "Unknown") %>% 
  filter(sex != "Other")

#glimpse(cleaning_covid_data)

#glimpse(covid_deaths)

#Graphical reflection
ggplot(data = covid_deaths, aes(x = age_group, y = death_percentage)) + geom_col(fill = "#6b7ca4", show.legend = FALSE) +

```

Looking at the plotted graphs, it is possible to derive three different assumptions:

* Higher age leads to a higher chance of death due to covid-19.

* The presence of co-morbidities increases the likelihood of death.

* Men are more likely to die due to covid-19 than women. An on average unhealthier lifestyle might be a possible explanation for this phenomen. For instance, men smoke more than women. 

# Covid death rate by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU

```{r, cache=TRUE}

#glimpse(covid_data)

#Data cleaning
cleaning_covid_icu <- covid_data %>% 
  filter(icu_yn != "Missing") %>% 
  filter(icu_yn != "Unknown") %>%
  filter(age_group != "Unknown") %>% 
  filter(sex != "Missing") %>% 
  filter(sex != "Unknown") %>% 
  filter(sex != "Other") %>% 
  filter(death_yn != "Unknown") %>% 
  filter(death_yn != "Missing")

#glimpse(cleaning_covid_icu)

#Adding the death percentage
icu_covid <- cleaning_covid_icu %>% 
  group_by(age_group,sex,icu_yn,death_yn) %>% 
  count() %>% 
  pivot_wider(names_from = death_yn, values_from = n) %>% 
  summarize(death_percentage = Yes/(Yes+No))

#glimpse(icu_covid)
```

```{r, cache=TRUE}
#Change label names
icu_covid$icu_yn_names <- factor(icu_covid$icu_yn,
levels = c("Yes", "No"),
labels = c("Admitted to ICU", "No ICU"))

#glimpse(icu_covid)

#Graphical reflection
ggplot(data = icu_covid, aes(x = age_group, y = death_percentage)) + geom_col(fill = "#fe9481", show.legend = FALSE) + 
  geom_text(aes(label = round(death_percentage*100, 1), hjust = 0.6)) +
#Add labels   
  labs(title = "Covid death % by age group, sex and whether patient was admitted to ICU", caption = "Source:CDC") + 
#Add theme and further features  
  theme_bw() + 
  theme(axis.title.x = element_blank(), axis.title.y = element_blank()) + scale_y_continuous(labels = scales::percent) + 
#Flip axis  
  coord_flip() + 
#Create separate graphs depending on sex and co-morbidities  
  facet_grid(icu_yn_names ~ sex)
```

Looking at the plotted graphs, it is possible to derive three interesting assumptions:

* Not surprisingly, chances of death increase if people had to be admitted to ICU. This accounts for all age groups.

* People aged 80+ are very likely (~80%) to die from covid-19 if admitted to ICU. 

* Mortality rate for men is higher independent from ICU care.
