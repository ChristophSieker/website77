title: Wisdom of alcohol spreads across the globe
---



<p>Looking at the data, it appears like a metaphor of my vision of a better European Union. On the one hand, alcohol seems to unite the whole world - almost everybody consumes it. On the other hand, each country and geographical region has its own preferences and focus on specific alcoholic drinks. Similarly, I imagine Europe - united by common values, but each country is able to develop it full potential and to focus on its individual strengths.</p>

<p>Namibia has the highest yearly consumption of beer per capita. Beer is one of Namibiaâ€™s most iconic commodity and their top quality brewing is a legacy of German colonialism.The second most beer-loving country is Czech Republic, known for its unique brewing methods and prevalent drinking culture.</p>

<p>The above graph, representing wine consumption, shows that French and Portuguese drink the most wine. It is not very surprising given these are one of the most well known wine producing countries in the world.</p>

<p>Last but not least, looking at the last plot we can see that Grenada and Belarus are the most spirit-loving countries. We can safely assume that Grenadians prefer to drink rum while Belorussians enjoy their vodka.</p>
