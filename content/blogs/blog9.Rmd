Looking at the data, it appears like a metaphor of my vision of a better European Union. On the one hand, alcohol seems to unite the whole world - almost everybody consumes it. On the other hand, each country and geographical region has its own preferences and focus on specific alcoholic drinks. Similarly, I imagine Europe - united by common values, but each country is able to develop it full potential and to focus on its individual strengths.  

```{r, load_alcohol_data}

drinks <- vroom(here::here("data","drinks.csv"))

# Where Do People Drink The Most Beer?

```{r beer_plot, fig.width=10}
desc_beer<- drinks %>% 
#Sort in descending order
  arrange(desc(beer_servings))

#Selecting the Top 25
top25_beer<-head(desc_beer,25)

#Plotting
ggplot(top25_beer,aes(x=reorder(country,beer_servings),y=beer_servings)) + geom_col(fill="brown") + 
#Adding labels
  labs(x="Country", y="Beer Servings", 
       title="Top 25 Beer Consuming Countries", caption = "Source:FiveThirtyEight") + 
#Switch axis
  coord_flip() +
#Add theme
  theme_clean() + 
  NULL
```

Namibia has the highest yearly consumption of beer per capita. Beer is one of Namibia's most iconic commodity and their top quality brewing is a legacy of German colonialism.The second most beer-loving country is Czech Republic, known for its unique brewing methods and prevalent drinking culture. 

# Where Do People Drink The Most Wine?

```{r wine_plot, fig.width=10}

desc_wine<- drinks %>% 
#Sort in descending order
  arrange(desc(wine_servings))

#Selecting the Top 25
top25_wine<-head(desc_wine,25)

#Plotting
ggplot(top25_wine,aes(x=reorder(country,wine_servings),y=wine_servings)) + geom_col(fill="maroon") + 
#Adding labels  
  labs(x="Country", y="Wine Servings", 
       title="Top 25 Wine Consuming Countries", caption = "Source:FiveThirtyEight") + 
#Switch axis
  coord_flip() +
#Add theme
  theme_clean() + NULL


```

The above graph, representing wine consumption, shows that French and Portuguese drink the most wine. It is not very surprising given these are one of the most well known wine producing countries in the world.


# Where Do People Drink The Most Spirits?

```{r spirit_plot, fig.width=10}
desc_spirit<- drinks %>% 
#Sort in descending order
  arrange(desc(spirit_servings))

#Selecting the Top 25
top25_spirit<-head(desc_spirit,25)

#Plotting
ggplot(top25_spirit,aes(x=reorder(country,spirit_servings),y=spirit_servings)) + geom_col(fill="grey") + 
#Adding labels
  labs(x="Country", y="Spirit Servings", 
       title="Top 25 Spirit Consuming Countries", caption = "Source:FiveThirtyEight") + 
#Switch axis
  coord_flip() + 
#Add theme
  theme_clean() + 
  NULL

```
 
Last but not least, looking at the last plot we can see that Grenada and Belarus are the most spirit-loving countries. We can safely assume that Grenadians prefer to drink rum while Belorussians enjoy their vodka.
